# A Simple Example: Basic comparisons and Boolean expressions
# Checking for equality
a = 10
b = 20
print(a == b)  

# Checking for inequality
print(a != b)  

# Using 'and' to check multiple conditions
x = 5
y = 10
print(x > 2 and y < 15)  

# Using 'or' to check multiple conditions
print(x < 2 or y > 5)  

# Checking whether a value is not in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(6 not in numbers)  

# Boolean expressions
is_raining = False
has_umbrella = True
print(is_raining and has_umbrella)
